                    I am a self taught developer, it is just amazing to see
                    how logic is applied in programming. And I love programming and so
                    for most of the time that I am free I do programming. I started
                    with different languages on YouTube but it was hard to learn from
                    YouTube so I went on to try a book named <b>"Head First Python"</b>.
                    It gave me a strong base at basic Python then its all thanks to
                    Google that I gradually learned by just searching things.
                    
                    Stackoverflow is also one of my favorite platforms to fix things
                    and get how to guides although its against their guidelines.
                    I am relatively new to HTML and CSS but thanks again to Google
                    Searches that I learnt it in a search and understand way.

                    I like Linux and Open Source. And believe it or not I like this
                    logo simplification trend. It just makes the logos feel more
                    modernized to me (Yes, I hate those 3d buttons used in old programs!)
