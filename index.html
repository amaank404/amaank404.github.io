        <h1> Xcodz-Dot's Profile </h1>
        <h2 id="about"> About Me: </h2>
        <p>
            I am a self taught developer, it is just amazing to see
            how logic is applied in programming. And I love programming and so
            for most of the time that I am free I do programming. I started
            with different languages on YouTube but it was hard to learn from
            YouTube so I went on to try a book named <b>"Head First Python"</b>.
            It gave me a strong base at basic Python then its all thanks to
            Google that I gradually learned by just searching things.
            
            Stackoverflow is also one of my favorite platforms to fix things
            and get how to guides although its against their guidelines.
            I am relatively new to HTML and CSS but thanks again to Google
            Searches that I learnt it in a search and understand way.

            I like Linux and Open Source. And believe it or not I like this
            logo simplification trend. It just makes the logos feel more
            modernized to me (Yes, I hate those 3d buttons used in old programs!)
        </p>
        <h2 id="projects"> My Projects </h2>
        <p>
            I have all my projects listed on <a href="https://github.com/xcodz-dot">my Github Profile</a>
            out of which some of them are pinned which are my favorites and the
            ones I am currently working on are

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/xcodz-dot/NimNN">NimNN</a> - Neural Networks in nim</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/xcodz-dot/NimNN">Web95</a> - An old retro theme for personal websites (including this one)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3> NimNN </h3>
        <p>
            I wrote a genetic neural network algorithm from scratch in Nim. And
            I have to say that it's fast. Although this is also true that the
            algorithm used in it is probabbly one of the most inefficient ones.
            Below is a demonstration video for the same.
        </p>
        <video class="content-container" controls src="/static/videos/NNsim demonstration.mp4"></video>
        <p>
            I do plan to improve its algorithm over time that it becomes better at
            performance and also better at training. Currently the training algorithm
            is really weak and works on the basis of random genome changes instead
            of progressive genome changes. Probabbly I would like to adapt more towards
            NEAT algorithm.
        </p>

        <h2 id="proglangs"> My Languages </h2>
        <p>
            I like learning new programming languages and I beleive that I 
            am good at memory structures. Beleive it or not, I do know how
            pointers work (although I am a Python dev). I can fluently write
            in following languages :-
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            And other languages that I am good enough at are :-
            <ul>
                <li>Rust</li>
                <li>Nim</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Nim is probabbly not something you've heard of before but its
            probabbly my favorite of all languages. It offers a lot of ease
            of life programming features. Although not quite popular amongst
            the market, I still would like to use nim for my personal
            projects.
